## Project Description (QR Code-Based Metro Ticketing System)
### Introduction 
<p align="justify">
  We want to develop a QR code-based metro ticketing system that generates a unique QR code for users upon each trip. The system records the entry station when the user scans the QR code at the entry gate and tracks the exit station when the QR code is scanned again at the destination. Fares are calculated based on predefined rates set by the admin, and the charges are automatically deducted from the userâ€™s account balance. Users can top up their account balance via a mobile app or website.
</p>

### User Requirements 
1.	Users must log in with their credentials (e.g., email & password or OTP) to access the system.
2.	Users can add funds to their account through an integrated payment gateway (e.g., credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or mobile banking).
3.	Users can generate a unique QR code for each trip, which is valid for a single journey.
4.	Users can use the generated QR code to enter and exit the station by scanning it at the respective gates.
5.	Users can view detailed travel records, including entry/exit stations, travel time, fare deductions, and transaction history.
6.	Users can generate a QR code in advance in case of network issues. The system validates it upon scanning at the gates.
7.	Users receive notifications about low balances and prompts to recharge before their next trip.
8.	Users can calculate the fare for a journey before starting their trip by selecting the entry and exit stations.
9.	Users can manage multiple tickets (e.g., for family or group travel).
10.	Users can manage multiple tickets in a single trip.
11.	Users can report lost items through the system, and the system notifies station admins for assistance.
12.	Users receive real-time updates about station closures, maintenance, delays, or other service disruptions.

### Admin Requirements
1.	Admins can add, update, or remove stations from the system as needed.
2.	Admins can set or adjust fare rates based on travel distances.
3.	Admins can monitor overall system activity, including income reports, passenger statistics, and trip records.
4.	Admins can block users involved in fraudulent activities and impose penalties for rule violations.
5.	Admins can access a live dashboard to view station occupancy, active users, and ongoing trips in real-time.
6.	Admins can handle refund requests and resolve transaction disputes efficiently.
7.	Admins can send real-time alerts to passengers in case of emergencies or unexpected disruptions.
8.	Admins can generate detailed reports on revenue, user visits, and other key metrics.
